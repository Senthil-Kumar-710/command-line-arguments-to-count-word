Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming
Rumbling, Rumbling
Beware
Coming for you
All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear
Tearless, fearless, burning, burning
You tell me what have I missed
Still wandering in the deep mist
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
